# Shortest Path Algorithm

## Description
This repository offers a comprehensive collection of algorithms focused on finding the shortest path in a graph. Feel free to contribute by adding any algorithms you know, allowing others to reference and benefit from them.

## Algorithms
1. Breadth-First Search (BFS)
2. Depth-First Search (DFS)
3. Dijkstra's Algorithm
4. A* Algorithm

## Note*
To run the code, please install the `pygame` library:
- Open your terminal or command prompt.
- Enter the following command:  
```bash
    pip install pygame  
```
